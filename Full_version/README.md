# SHA256/utf-8

- ## Usage :

```
First, you got to specify wich file you want to encrypt, then you specify 
the name of the output file, last you got to enter the key you want to use 
in raw text (you can't save the key).
```

# Blowfish

- ## Usage :

```
First, you got to specify wich file you want to encrypt,then you specify 
the name of the output file, last you got to create a key file or use an 
existant key file.  
```

# AES-256-CBC

- ## Usage :

```
First, you got to specify wich file you want to encrypt, then you specify 
the name of the output file, last you got to create a key file or use an 
existant key file.    
```

# RSA-2048

- ## Usage :

```
First, you got to generate a RSA private and a RSA public key.

For encryption, you got to specify the name of the file you want to encrypt, 
select the RSA public key to encrypt the data.

For decryption, you got to specify the name of the file you want to decrypt, 
select the RSA private key to decrypt the data.
```

# AES-RSA

- ## Usage :

```
First, the receiver of the future encrypted data got to generate an AES key, 
a RSA private and a RSA public key.

For encryption, you got to specify the name of the file you want to encrypt, 
select the AES key to encrypt the data, and then select the RSA public key 
to encrypt the AES key.

For decryption, you got to specify the name of the file you want to decrypt, 
select the encrypted AES key, and then select the RSA private key to decrypt 
the AES key.
```

- ## Functioning :

 ### Key Generation :
  
```
When generating keys, you got to input a name (exemple : test), then 3 file
will be create;

test_aes.key = the AES key, 32 random bytes generated by the Crypto.Random utils by pycryptodome lib

test_private_key.pem = the RSA private key, generated by crpytography lib (.PEM format (----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----))

test_public_key.pem = the RSA public key, generated with the RSA private key by crpytography lib (.PEM format (----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----))
```

### File Encryption :
  
```
When encrypting a file, the file is encrypted with the AES-256-CBC cipher, 
then the AES key used is encrpyted with the RSA public key of the receiver
(previously send by the receiver).

The sender push the encrypted data and the encrypted AES key to the receiver.
```

   ### File Decryption :
  
```
When decrypting, the AES key is decrypted with the receiver's RSA private key
Then the encrypted data is decrypted by the AES key.
```
